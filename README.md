# iceland2018

It's some family photos plus my workflow for taking a buncha files in a directory and making them web-friendly with imageindex and lightbox and publishing them with Netlify and a custom domain.

The "production" site should be https://iceland2018.cliff1976.net.

Nice to get all this working for free!
